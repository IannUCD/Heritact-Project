**Note: This plugin is currently under development and is a work in progress. It may not be fully functional or optimized at this stage. Use with caution.**

## Description

The Heightmap Plugin for QGIS is designed to convert raster files into heightmaps, enriching them with data from OpenStreetMap. Heightmaps are grayscale representations of terrain elevation, where the pixel values correspond to the height of the terrain at that location.

This plugin aims to provide QGIS users with the ability to generate heightmaps from raster files while also incorporating information about various features such as buildings, roads, water bodies, and more, sourced from OpenStreetMap.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin zip folder from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/heightmap-plugin/releases) section.
2. Open QGIS and navigate to "Plugins" > "Manage and Install Plugins."
3. Click the "Install from ZIP" button.
4. Select the downloaded zip folder and click "Install Plugin."

## Usage

1. Once the plugin is installed, you can access it either from the plugin toolbar or the plugin menu in QGIS.
2. Click on the "Convert to Heightmap" option to open the plugin interface.
3. Select raster files to convert to heightmaps.
4. The plugin will process the selected raster files, generating heightmaps enriched with OpenStreetMap data.

## Important Notes

- This plugin is currently a work in progress and may not be fully functional or optimized.
